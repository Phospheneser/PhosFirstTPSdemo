# PhosFirstTPSdemo
My first TPS attempt on making TPS game


## Functions already implemented：
- Normal movement, fast running(shift), and silent walking(ctrl)
- Aiming and firing(left click & right click)
- Armor and Health(losing armorfirst when taking damage)(armor can cure itself but Health cannot)
- Changing bullet ("R")
- UI
- A message pop-up  when kill an enemy
- AI patrol and chanse when player is found
- AI dead
- Pick up weapons on the ground
- Changing weapons("1","2")(can only be used after picking up a weapon)
- Pickable ammunition

## Current Problems：
- No jump animation
- AI cannot attack
- Cant play online
- Grenade and flashbang system has not been developed
- Collimation offset
- The camera will move outside the wall
- Animation mutation causes a sudden change in perspective when moving left or right
- The gun model is finished and will be displayed on the map, but because the painting style does not match I used two brand new weapons


This is my first attempt at making a TPS game or even using the UE engine, following the introductory tutorial to complete a shooter demo that can attack the AI, but there are still huge problems with the online aspect, unfortunately leaving me not enough time to make it, and the quality of the tutorial is not very high, but I have found a better tutorial, and I will make a more satisfying TPS demo when I have the chance.
